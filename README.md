Connect Four is a fun game for two players. The players place discs on a vertical board that is 7 columns wide and 6 rows tall. The goal of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. The task of the project is to develop this game with a number of improvements.

The solution is build up step by step over several stages. Stage 1: Make first steps in game development â€” your game should read input data and work with strings from the console.
Stage 2: Print strings to the console and build the game board.
Stage 3: Develop the game logic and construct a loop that changes the game board based on players' input.
Stage 4: Design the win and draw logic. The program should determine whether a situation on the game board meets the win or draw criteria.
Stage 5: Allow players to play multiple games and keep their score. Let it be a competition!
